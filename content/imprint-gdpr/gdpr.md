## Overview of data processing

The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes 
of their processing and refers to the data subjects.

### Types of data processed

* Inventory data (e.g. names, nicknames).
* Content data (e.g. entries in online forms).
* Contact details (e.g. email, phone numbers).
* Meta / communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
* Usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).

### Categories of data subjects

* Communication partner.
* Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).

### Purposes of processing

* Contact requests and communication.
* Provision of contractual services and customer service.

### Relevant legal bases

In the following we share the legal basis of the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), on the basis of which we process the personal data. Please 
note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, the national data 
protection requirements in your or our country of residence and domicile may 
apply. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will 
inform you of this in the data protection declaration.

* **Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR)** - The data subject has given 
  their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose 
  or for several specific purposes.
* **Fulfillment of the contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 
  S. 1 lit. b. GDPR)** - Processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a 
  contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation of 
  pre-contractual measures at the request of the data subject respectively.
* **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR)** - The processing 
  is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible 
  or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of 
  the data subject, which protect personal data Data require, predominate.

**National data protection regulations in Germany**: In addition to the data 
protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national data 
protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law on 
the protection against misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal 
Data Protection Act - BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special 
regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right of 
objection, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing 
for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in 
individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates data processing for 
the purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in particular 
with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment 
relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection 
laws of the individual federal states can be applied.

### Safety measures

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with 
the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the 
implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of 
processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent 
of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to ensure a level 
of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity 
and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the 
data as well as the access, input, transfer, securing of availability and their 
separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of 
data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions to the threat to the 
data. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already in the 
development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance 
with the principle of data protection, through technology design and data 
protection-friendly default settings.

**SSL encryption (https)**: We use SSL encryption to protect your data 
transmitted via our online offer. You can recognize such encrypted connections 
by the prefix https: // in the address line of your browser.

### Provision of the online services and web hosting

In order to be able to provide our online offer safely and efficiently, we use 
the services of one or more web hosting providers, from whose servers (or 
servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these purposes, 
we can use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage 
space and database services as well as security services and technical 
maintenance services.

The data processed as part of the provision of the hosting offer can include 
all information relating to the users of our online offer that is generated in 
the context of use and communication. This regularly includes the IP address, 
which is necessary in order to be able to deliver the content of online offers 
to browsers, and all entries made within our online offer or from websites.

**Collection of access data and log files**: We ourselves (or our web hosting 
provider) collect data on every access to the server (so-called server log 
files). The server log files can include the address and name of the websites 
and files accessed, the date and time of the access, the amount of data 
transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the 
user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a 
rule, IP Addresses and the requesting provider belong.

The server log files can be used on the one hand for security purposes, e.g. 
to avoid overloading the server (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-
called DDoS attacks) and on the other hand to ensure the load on the servers 
and their stability.

* Processed data types: content data (e.g. entries in online forms), usage data 
  (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta / 
  communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).
* Affected persons: users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
* Purposes of processing: Content Delivery Network (CDN), provision of 
  contractual services and customer service.
* Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

### Deletion of data

The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal 
requirements as soon as the consent permitted for processing is revoked or 
other permissions are no longer applicable (e.g. if the purpose of processing 
this data is no longer applicable or is not required for the purpose).

If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally 
permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. This 
means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This

whose storage is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal 
claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

individual data protection information of this data protection declaration.
