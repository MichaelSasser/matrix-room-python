This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
Matrix community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. 
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, 
and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code 
of conduct may be banned from the community.

This applies to conversation in the Python room `@Python3:matrix.org`.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient**.
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports 
  people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not 
  limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, 
  colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, 
  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family 
  status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in 
  turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will 
  affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into 
  account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, 
  so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement 
  is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience 
  some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
  into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where 
  people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do not insult
  or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour 
  aren't acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and 
  technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements 
  and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The 
  strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range 
  of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being 
  unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re 
  wrong . Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t 
  get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning 
  from mistakes.
