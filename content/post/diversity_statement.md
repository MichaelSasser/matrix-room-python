We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community 
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as 
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we 
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or 
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do 
our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, 
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national 
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, 
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate 
discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including 
participants with disabilities.

The `@Python3:matrix.org` room takes a position on acceptable behaviour for its 
community as defined by the CoC, and we will not endorse behaviour which is 
counter to that.
