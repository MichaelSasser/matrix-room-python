<h2 class=section-heading>Matrix Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
Matrix community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour.
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all,
and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code
of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>
<p>This applies to communication in any room of the Python community Matrix Space
<code>#python-community:matrix.org</code>.</p>
<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be friendly and patient</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not
limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
<li><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in
turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will
affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
account when making decisions. Remember that we&rsquo;re a world-wide community,
so you might not be communicating in someone else&rsquo;s primary language.</li>
<li><strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience
some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where
people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>
<li><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: Be kind to others. Do not insult
or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour
aren&rsquo;t acceptable.</li>
<li><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The
strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range
of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being
unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re
wrong . Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t
get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning
from mistakes.</li>

<h2 class=section-heading>Diversity Statement</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.</p>
<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate
discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including
participants with disabilities.</p>
<p>The <code>@Python3:matrix.org</code> room takes a position on acceptable behaviour for its
community as defined by the CoC, and we will not endorse behaviour which is
counter to that.</p>
