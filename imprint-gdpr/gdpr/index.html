Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, the national data protection requirements in your or our country of residence and domicile may apply. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of this in the data protection declaration.</p><ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a specific purpose or for several specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Fulfillment of the contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b.

This includes in particular the law on the protection against misuse of personal data during data processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right of objection, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. It also regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states can be applied.</p><h2 id=safety-measures>Safety measures</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p><p>The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, transfer, securing of availability and their separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions to the threat to the data. Furthermore, we consider the protection of personal data already in the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.</p><p><strong>SSL encryption (https)</strong>: We use SSL encryption to protect your data transmitted via our online offer.
